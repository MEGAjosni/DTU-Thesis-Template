# DTU Thesis Template

This is a custom, unofficial thesis template for Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It is designed to follow the DTU Design Guide; however, full compliance is not guaranteed.

**Important:** This is *NOT* an official DTU template. For official templates and guidelines on producing DTU-compliant materials, please refer to the DTU Design Guide: https://designguide.dtu.dk/

## Usage
The file "setup/statics.tex" contains user-defined commands where you should specify 
formalities regarding your thesis, such as Name, Title, Supervisor etc.

To add a signature on the signature-line, put a png-file named "signature.png" containing your signature in the folder "frontmatter/front_gfx".
